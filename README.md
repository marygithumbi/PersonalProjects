## Background

Hello! 

My name is Mary and I was formally trained in Neuroscience and the philosophical underpinings of Artificial Intelligence.The one concept that I took away from my degree is neuroplasticity, a term that means our brains adapt to the changing environment we place it in. I spend a lot of my time finding out what projects are relevant to my career and how other companies and people within these companies are generating value.
